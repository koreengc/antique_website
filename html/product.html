                                <p>Just listed three after along wait. I expect them to sell quickly, 
                                    so don't hesitated if you want one.</p>
                                <p>This is a beautiful example of a GPO 1/232L with drawer. 
                                    The handset is dated 1956. It has been stripped down and 
                                    rebuilt after each part has been cleaned and polished. 
                                    The dial has been set up to work on both BT and cable networks 
                                    using a special line simulator. It has a Genuine GPO No10 stainless
                                     steel fronted enamel alpha numeric dial face. The No1 has rubbed 
                                     off but I didn't want to change it as it is a rare item. 
                                     If you prefer a perfect reproduction add that in the notice 
                                     to us and I will fit a perfect reproduction. It is fitted with
                                      a very best quality hand plaited braided handset cord, a very 
                                      high quality "D" shaped plastic line in cord with a UK telephone
                                       plug socket and an electronic microphone to bring the speech 
                                       quality up to modern standards. This model was designed to be 
                                       fitted to a GPO No 26 bell set and so had no internal bell. 
                                       I have fitted a small bell inside that gives a very pleasant 
                                       ring but not very loud. Ideal for a bedroom or in a sitting 
                                       room. I can make a dial label with your information at no
                                        extra charge. This is ready to plug in and go. I can fit
                                         a dial label with your information at no extra charge.
                                          Add the details in the checkout system.</p>
                                <p>A note to mention is that most providers including BT are moving 
                                    over to Voip systems and so if you want to future proof the 
                                    ability to dial out I would recommend having the pulse to tone 
                                    unit fitted. If you just want to receive calls then it will 
                                    be fine. Fitting a pulse to tone unit to this model requires 
                                    some non standard internal wiring and the dial loom will be 
                                    removed as the unit has its own. If you want these returned 
                                    please make quite clear in the checkout notice to us.  </p>
